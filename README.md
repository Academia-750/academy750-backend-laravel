### Api Documentation

We are using  [Scribe](https://scribe.knuckles.wtf/laravel/). 
Scribe does most of the job we take care of:

1 - Requests: Add the bodyParameters or the queryParameters function.
2 - Resources: Add the Resource/ResourceCollection response to allow scribe deduce the autoput.
3 - In the controller add (if required) the @authenticated, @urlParam for url parameters and other HTTP status scenarios.
4 - The models are taken from the Factories. Using create from another factory inside our factory wont work for doc, you can add 
` config('app.env') === 'documentation'` check for this specific scenarios.

Update the documentation running `APP_ENV=documentation php artisan scribe:generate php artisan scribe:generate` or `yarn doc`

### Set Up the database

1 - Install MYSQL

2 - Create the tables for the database (and test database if required)

3 - Create a user and grand him access 

```

CREATE DATABASE bomberosapimysql;

```

### Sentry

If you have PHP 8.1.0 and you can not do

`php artisan sentry:test` 

getting the error

```
There was an error sending the event.
SDK: Failed to send the event to Sentry. Reason: "HTTP/2 stream 1 was reset for "https://o4505596447162368.ingest.sentry.io/api/4505596448210944/store/".".
Please check the error message from the SDK above for further hints about what went wrong.
```

Is due a problem with PHP CURL with sentry, you can reinstall sentry this way

composer update -W sentry/sentry-laravel

### Queues

Running queues we use `php artisan queue:work`.

For production we use SuperVisor (See the Server installation guide in Notion )
